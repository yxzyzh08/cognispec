# PRD: Cognispec - AI-Native Requirements Documentation Plugin

## 🎯 30-Second Overview

> **Cognispec** is a Claude Code plugin that transforms vague product ideas into structured, AI-optimized requirement documents. Designed for independent developers who use AI-assisted development, it solves the critical problem of "requirement amnesia" - where developers forget their own requirements after project interruptions, causing 80% completed projects to be discarded. Cognispec acts as an "external brain" that persists requirement memory, ensuring both humans and AI can align at any time through progressive disclosure documentation.

## Key Metrics

| **Ease of Use** | Subjective satisfaction | Author's personal experience |
| **Project Continuity** | Can resume after 1+ month interruption | Subjective experience |
| **AI Alignment** | AI-generated code matches expectations | Reduced revision cycles |

> **Note**: Success is measured by the author's subjective satisfaction, not quantitative metrics.
