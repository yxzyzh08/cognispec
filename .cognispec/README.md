## Progressive Disclosure Layers

All documents follow the progressive disclosure principle:

| Layer | Purpose | Reading Time |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Layer 1** | Executive summary | 30 seconds |
| **Layer 2** | Problem & solution | 2 minutes |
| **Layer 3** | Detailed requirements | As needed |
| **Layer 4** | Technical appendix | Expert level |

## How to Use

1. **Start with Discovery**: Run `/discover` to conduct requirements interview
2. **Research Market**: Run `/research` to analyze competitors
3. **Generate PRD**: Run `/prd` to create requirements documentation

## File Formats

- **Markdown files**: AI-optimized documentation (for Claude Code)
- **HTML files**: Human-readable interactive version (open in browser)

## Viewing PRD

For the best reading experience, generate and open the interactive HTML version:

**First time setup:**
```bash
cd .cognispec/scripts && npm install
```

**Generate HTML:**
```bash
node .cognispec/scripts/md2html.js --backup
```

**Then open:** `.cognispec/prd/human/index.html`

**Features:**
- Progressive disclosure with collapsible sections
- Sticky navigation bar
- Offline-ready (inline CSS, no CDN)
- Automatic backup before regeneration
