## Project Overview
> Cognispec - AI-Native Requirements Documentation Plugin: AI-Native Requirements Documentation

**Cognispec** is a Claude Code plugin that transforms vague product ideas into structured, AI-optimized requirement documents. Designed for independent developers who use AI-assisted development, it solves the critical problem of "requirement amnesia" - where developers forget their own requirements after project interruptions, causing 80% completed projects to be discarded. Cognispec acts as an "external brain" that persists requirement memory, ensuring both humans and AI can align at any time through progressive disclosure documentation.

## AI Instructions

### Reading Priority
1. Start with `summary.md` for quick project context (30 seconds)
2. Read `overview.md` for problem/solution understanding (2 minutes)
3. Use `requirements.md` for specific feature details (as needed)
4. Reference `appendix.md` for technical decisions and glossary (expert level)

### Task Format
Tasks follow Cognispec native JSON format:
- Simple, human-readable structure
- Phase-based organization
- See `tasks.json` for implementation tasks

### Code Generation Guidelines
- Follow patterns established in existing codebase
- Refer to `appendix.md` for technical constraints
- Check `requirements.md` for acceptance criteria before implementation
