## Progressive Disclosure Layers

All documents follow the progressive disclosure principle:

| Layer | Purpose | Reading Time |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Layer 1** | Executive summary | 30 seconds |
| **Layer 2** | Problem & solution | 2 minutes |
| **Layer 3** | Detailed requirements | As needed |
| **Layer 4** | Technical appendix | Expert level |

## How to Use

2. **Research Market**: Run `/research` to analyze competitors
3. **Generate PRD**: Run `/prd` to create requirements documentation
4. **Plan Development**: Run `/plan` to create development plan

## File Formats

- **Markdown files**: Human-readable documentation
- **JSON files**: Machine-readable task data (compatible with Task-Master-AI)

## Editing

You can edit any file in this directory. The commands will read existing content and build upon it rather than overwriting.
